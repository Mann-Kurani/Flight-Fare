Flight Fare Prediction: A Machine Learning Project

In the era where air travel is an integral part of modern lifestyles, predicting flight ticket prices has become crucial for informed trip planning. 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts flight fares based on various factors such as timing, destination, and duration of flights. 
The fluctuating nature of ticket prices, influenced by factors like vacations and festive seasons, makes it essential to have a tool that provides a basic idea of potential fares.

Key Tasks:

Data Exploration: Dive into the provided dataset to understand the characteristics and distribution of the data.

Data Cleaning: Cleanse the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and create new ones to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.

Model Building: Explore and implement different machine learning algorithms to find the best fit for predicting flight fares.

Model Testing: Evaluate the performance of the developed models using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

By undertaking these classical machine learning tasks, this project aims to empower users with a tool that can assist in making informed decisions about flight fares, ultimately saving both money and time for travelers.
