I apologize for the oversight. Let's adjust the hackathon tasks to better suit the Flight Fare Prediction dataset.

# Flight Fare Prediction

## Problem Description

The challenge involves predicting flight fares based on various features, aiming to create an accurate and reliable model for estimating airfare. This dataset is provided as part of the end-term exam in Methods and Algorithms in Machine Learning -1.

## Dataset Description

Target Attribute: "ticketprice" (continuous variable)

**CSV Files:**
- **train_data.csv:** Flight data with features and corresponding ticket prices.
- **test_data.csv:** Test data with features for prediction (excluding the target column).
- **Solution.csv:** Model output for test data evaluation.

*Note: The dataset may contain features such as departure time, airline, route, etc., influencing flight ticket prices.*

## Hackathon Tasks

### Data Preprocessing

Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and outliers. Ensure the data is ready for feature engineering and model training.

### Feature Engineering

Explore and create new features from existing ones. Consider transforming variables or combining features to improve the model's predictive performance.

### ML Modelling

Develop a robust flight fare prediction model using machine learning algorithms. Experiment with different models and evaluate their performance.

### Evaluation and Fine-Tuning

Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. Fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize the model for better accuracy.

## Evaluation Metric

The evaluation metric for this hackathon is the accuracy of ticket price predictions.
